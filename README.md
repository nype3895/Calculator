AI Calculator

I attempted to create a TI-83 calculator using Claude.ai. I chose this specific calculator model because it was the first one that came to mind. However, the final product was not functional, and I encountered several critical issues.

Issues Encountered

Missing Key Functionalities – The calculator lacked an equal (=) sign, preventing calculations from being completed.
Non-Functional Buttons – Essential functions like sin, cos, tan, and y= did not work, limiting its usability for mathematical operations.
Incomplete Equation Processing – I was unable to enter and execute full equations, making the calculator ineffective for practical use.
